# IDE++
#### National Public School, HSR
In an innovative world, individuals have learnt various programming languages. Especially in the business world, it has become exceptionally important, but members of a company may not know the same constructive language which may prove to be difficult during the construction of an innovative software.
With IDE++ software, We wish to create a custom IDE, where users may program in their own language and can be converted into other language through the use of a simple yet efficient algorithm. Furthermore a user can create their own programming language, which is useful for any future purpose.
